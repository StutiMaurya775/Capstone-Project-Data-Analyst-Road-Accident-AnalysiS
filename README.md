# Capstone-Project-Data-Analyst-Road-Accident-AnalysiS
## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data in India between 2003 and 2016. India has one of the highest road fatality rates in the world, and this analysis aims to extract meaningful insights using statistical methods. By leveraging Python and its data analysis libraries, we answer key questions such as trends in accidents, injuries, fatalities, and how factors like lanes, vehicle types, and reasons for accidents impact these statistics.
## Data Sources
The data used in this analysis comes from various reports on road accidents in India and is spread across several CSV files:

- roadAccStats13-16.csv: Road accident statistics from 2013 to 2016.
- Details_of_road_accident_deaths_by_situation_state_2014.csv: Data on road accident deaths by situation and state for 2014.
- Persons_killed_due_to_Non-use_of_Safety_Device_2016.csv: Statistics on deaths due to non-use of safety devices like helmets in 2016.
- Additional data files covering reasons for accidents, lanes, and vehicle types.

Each dataset focuses on different aspects of road accidents, such as offenders' gender, time of accidents, reasons, and number of lanes.

# Analysis Questions
This project answers the following questions:

1. What is the percentage of road accidents over the years?
2. What is the mean number of accidents per 1L population for each year?
3. Which state has the highest and lowest number of road accidents?
4. How do gender dynamics influence offenders and victims in road accidents?
5. What percentage of deaths occur due to non-wearing of helmets between males and females?
...

The full list of questions is addressed through statistical and graphical analysis.
## Methodology
- *Data Loading*: Data was loaded into Python using the pandas library for structured analysis.
- *Data Cleaning*: Missing values were handled, and datasets were merged where necessary.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Statistical summaries and visualizations were created using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- *Statistical Calculations*: Metrics like mean accidents, percentages, and totals were computed for each question.

- ## Visualizations
Various visualizations were created to better understand the data:
- Line plots for accidents over time.
- Bar charts for state-wise accident comparison.
- Pie charts for analyzing gender-based fatalities.
- Heatmaps for showing the distribution of accidents based on reasons or lanes.

Examples of these visualizations can be found in the /outputs folder or in the Jupyter notebooks.

## Results & Insights
Some key findings from the analysis:
1. Road accidents showed an increasing trend from 2003 to 2016, with a peak in [year].
2. States like [State A] reported the highest number of accidents, while [State B] had the lowest.
3. Non-wearing of helmets significantly contributed to deaths, especially among males.
4. Accidents tend to be higher during nighttime and on single-lane roads.

Additional insights are documented within the project notebooks.
